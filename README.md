# renewal_affect_shower
 simple code 
 
 I liked filip idea, but I noticed several problems that I think could be improved.

I added:

animation to the images using setscale

added information for the skills, getting their time and attribute information.

added a converter from SkillIndex to AffectIndex (since the source sends directly the skill id and it is necessary to convert it to work properly)

added a dictionary to add new affect

the code can be improved even more, but I wanted to give another small contribution
